# React On Rails Blank Application

This is a blank Rails application set up with React (Facebook JS lib for building UIs), Sprockets preprocessor for CJSX (CoffeeScript with React JSX markup), and Compass Stylesheet Authoring Framework for cross browser crap

## Settings

If you don't want to use React add-ons and want to have lightweight lib just comment this line in config/application.rb

```ruby
config.react.addons = true
```
